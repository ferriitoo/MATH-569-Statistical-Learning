    "In summary, the forward and backward propagation processes are essential for training a neural network using the cross-entropy loss function. Forward propagation calculates the predicted probabilities for each class given an input, while backward propagation computes the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model parameters. These gradients are then used to update the model parameters, iteratively refining the model's predictions and minimizing the cross-entropy loss over the training data."
