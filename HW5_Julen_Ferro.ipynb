We have shown that $\\hat{\\beta}{j0}$ is a non-decreasing function of $\\sum{i\\in G_j} K_\\lambda(x_0, x_i)$, which means that both classification methods classify $x_0$ to class $j$ that maximizes the smoothed count of class $j$. This is an intuitive way to classify new observations based on their neighbors. Therefore, the locally constant multinomial logit model is also an effective method for classification, especially when the underlying relationship between the predictors and response is non-linear and local."
